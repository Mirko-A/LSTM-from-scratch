INT. DR. MELFI'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
THOMAS SOPRANO, 40, sits and waits. Uneasily. Staring confusedly at a vaguely erotic Klimpt reproduction. Inner door opens. DR. JENNIFER MELFI (attractive, 35) appears.
MELFI
Mr. Soprano?
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Melfi gestures Tommy to a choice of seating.
MELFI
Have a seat.
She seats herself in a facing armchair. She looks at him with a polite, expectant gaze. He stares back, waiting. There is utter silence. Nothing happens. Such is psychotherapy. Finally-
MELFI
My understanding from your family physician, Dr. Cusamano, is you collapsed? Were unable to breathe? Possibly a panic attack?
TOMMY
They said it was a panic attack - because all the neurological work and blood came back negative. They sent me here.
MELFI
You don't agree you had a panic attack?
He laughs - too loud.
MELFI
How are you feeling now?
TOMMY
Now? Fine. I'm back at work.
MELFI
What line of work are you in?
TOMMY
Waste management consultant.
She keeps that psychiatric poker-face. Yet there was a reaction.
After silence...
TOMMY
Look...it's impossible for me to talk to a psychiatrist.
MELFI
Any thoughts at all on why you blacked out?
Tommy shrugs. Fidgets. Then -
TOMMY
I don't know. Stress, maybe?
MELFI
Stress? About what?
DAWN
the first rays over the post-industrial landscape.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Well, I once heard some guy use this expression, 'The sun setting over the empire...?'
EXT. SOPRANO HOUSE - DAWN
split-level. New Jersey. The only thing distinguishing it from its neighbors is high security fencing and mercury vapor lamps that make the lawn bright enough for night baseball. A sensor reels the dawn's rays and the lamps switch off and -
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN
TOMMY'S EYE
slams open from sleep. He stares soberly up at the ceiling.
TOMMY (V.O.)
That morning of the day I got sick? I'd been thinking: it's good to be in a thing from the ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling I might be in at the end. That the best is over.
EXT. SOPRANO HOUSE - DAY
Bathrobed Tommy reads his morning paper in the gated driveway: CLINTON WARNS MEDICARE COULD BE BANKRUPT BY YEAR 2000. Tommy goes to the Sports, ambles down the driveway.
MELFI (V.O.)
Many Americans, I think, feel this.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Take my father. He never reached the heights like me. But in ways he had it better. He had his people - they had their standards. They had pride. Today what do we got?
MELFI (V.O.)
Did you have this feeling of loss more acutely in the hours before you collapsed?
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - DAY
An expanse of lawn, then a pool with Tropitone furniture. Tommy gathers speed, excited. But reaching the pool, he looks around, worried. The water is like glass. The morning is too still.
TOMMY (V.O.)
I dunno. Couple months before all this these two wild ducks had landed in my pool. Amazing. From Canada or someplace, I don't know. It was mating season.
DUCK FAMILY
wild mallards, mother and babies, comes waddling from the bushes, QUACKING. Tommy beams, takes feed from a bin and drops down on both knees. He feeds them.
TOMMY
Yum. Yum.
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
CARMELA SOPRANO (mid 30's), in bathrobe, makes breakfast for her kids. She is a dark-eyed, dark-haired, pretty woman with blonde hi-lites. Hi-lites and nails are a priority. At the table are MEADOW SOPRANO, 15, and her friend, HUNTER SCANGARELO.
TOMMY (V.O.)
My daughter's friend was there to drive my daughter, Meadow, to school.
HUNTER
staring out window
Meadow, your father with those ducks.
CARMELA
Have something more than just cran-apple juice, ladies. You need brain food for school.
TOMMY JR. enters. He's thirteen. He sits, starts spooning cereal in. Carmela smooches him. Everyone ad-libs happy birthdays. He acknowledges, his mouth crammed with food.
HUNTER.
The male and female duck just made a home in your pool and 'did it'? Weird.
CARMELA
crosses with pastry
Girls, you want some of last night's sfogliatell'?
MEADOW
Get out of here with that fat.
CARMELA
Oh, have a bite.
MEADOW
Wait - like Italian pastry is brain food?
HUNTER
Bon Jovi? Hello?
They laugh. Tommy Jr.'s hand goes in the box; he dunks the Italian pastry in his cereal milk and eats. The girls 'ee-ew'.
HUNTER
How do you stay so skinny, Mrs. Soprano?
Carmela isn't listening. She is staring out somberly.
CARMELA
Him. With those ducks.
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - POOL - DAY
Tommy has waded into the pool to adjust a plywood launching ramp he has constructed for the ducks. His robe floats on the water; he doesn't care. He talks to the ducks.
TOMMY
Don't you worry. I'll make you a better ramp.
The ducklings suddenly furiously flap tneir wings in proto flight, following their mother's lead.
TOMMY
Kids! Come here!
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
TOMMY (V.O.)
Hey, kids!
The teenagers trudge dutifully to the door.
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - POOL - DAY
TOMMY
Look! They're trying to fly.
KIDS
bored, humoring
Nice, dad. National Geographic.
They go back inside.
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
HUNTER
It is so cool you're going to be able to come to Aspen with my family at Christmas. Last year at Aspen? I saw Skeet Ulrich. As close as from where you're sitting.
MEADOW
Omigod.
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
TOMMY
My wife feels this friend of Meadow's is a bad influence.
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
CARMELA
Miss Meadow, we made a deal - you keep your school grades up and you keep your curfew between now and Christmas - then you get to go.
MEADOW
edge
I know that.
Tommy enters, robe gone, his lower torso wrapped in a beach towel. He claps Tommy Jr. on the back.
TOMMY
Happy birthday, son.
He runs his hand on Carmela's butt, but she seems not to notice.
So he starts slap fighting with Tommy Jr.
CARMELA
You're going to be home tonight for Tommy Jr.'s party, right?
to his grunt
Birdman. Hello?
Tommy is reaching for The Audubon Society "Master Guide to Birding" and getting engrossed.
TOMMY
I'll get home from work early.
CARMELA
I wasn't talking about work.
She moves off sullenly. As he watches her -
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Tommy - in the present - a strained silence. She stares.
TOMMY
This isn't going to work. I can't talk about my personal life.
MELFI
It's hard for everybody.
TOMMY
You don't understand.
MELFI
Finish telling me about the day you collapsed.
