# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network implementation from scratch

## Python

An implementation done in Python (contains both .py and .ipynb scripts) of an LSTM neural network using nothing but numpy.

### Usage

```console
cd python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./lstm.py
```

## C++

An implementation done in C++ using no libraries whatsoever. Much slower compared to numpy version, done only for educational purposes.

### Usage

```console
cd cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./LSTM
```
