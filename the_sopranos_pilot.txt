INT. DR. MELFI'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
THOMAS SOPRANO, 40, sits and waits. Uneasily. Staring confusedly at a vaguely erotic Klimpt reproduction. Inner door opens. DR. JENNIFER MELFI (attractive, 35) appears.
MELFI
Mr. Soprano?
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Melfi gestures Tommy to a choice of seating.
MELFI
Have a seat.
She seats herself in a facing armchair. She looks at him with a polite, expectant gaze. He stares back, waiting. There is utter silence. Nothing happens. Such is psychotherapy. Finally-
MELFI
My understanding from your family physician, Dr. Cusamano, is you collapsed? Were unable to breathe? Possibly a panic attack?
TOMMY
They said it was a panic attack - because all the neurological work and blood came back negative. They sent me here.
MELFI
You don't agree you had a panic attack?
He laughs - too loud.
MELFI
How are you feeling now?
TOMMY
Now? Fine. I'm back at work.
MELFI
What line of work are you in?
TOMMY
Waste management consultant.
She keeps that psychiatric poker-face. Yet there was a reaction.
After silence...
TOMMY
Look...it's impossible for me to talk to a psychiatrist.
MELFI
Any thoughts at all on why you blacked out?
Tommy shrugs. Fidgets. Then -
TOMMY
I don't know. Stress, maybe?
MELFI
Stress? About what?
DAWN
the first rays over the post-industrial landscape.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Well, I once heard some guy use this expression, 'The sun setting over the empire...?'
EXT. SOPRANO HOUSE - DAWN
split-level. New Jersey. The only thing distinguishing it from its neighbors is high security fencing and mercury vapor lamps that make the lawn bright enough for night baseball. A sensor reels the dawn's rays and the lamps switch off and -
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN
TOMMY'S EYE
slams open from sleep. He stares soberly up at the ceiling.
TOMMY (V.O.)
That morning of the day I got sick? I'd been thinking: it's good to be in a thing from the ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling I might be in at the end. That the best is over.
EXT. SOPRANO HOUSE - DAY
Bathrobed Tommy reads his morning paper in the gated driveway: CLINTON WARNS MEDICARE COULD BE BANKRUPT BY YEAR 2000. Tommy goes to the Sports, ambles down the driveway.
MELFI (V.O.)
Many Americans, I think, feel this.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Take my father. He never reached the heights like me. But in ways he had it better. He had his people - they had their standards. They had pride. Today what do we got?
MELFI (V.O.)
Did you have this feeling of loss more acutely in the hours before you collapsed?
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - DAY
An expanse of lawn, then a pool with Tropitone furniture. Tommy gathers speed, excited. But reaching the pool, he looks around, worried. The water is like glass. The morning is too still.
TOMMY (V.O.)
I dunno. Couple months before all this these two wild ducks had landed in my pool. Amazing. From Canada or someplace, I don't know. It was mating season.
DUCK FAMILY
wild mallards, mother and babies, comes waddling from the bushes, QUACKING. Tommy beams, takes feed from a bin and drops down on both knees. He feeds them.
TOMMY
Yum. Yum.
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
CARMELA SOPRANO (mid 30's), in bathrobe, makes breakfast for her kids. She is a dark-eyed, dark-haired, pretty woman with blonde hi-lites. Hi-lites and nails are a priority. At the table are MEADOW SOPRANO, 15, and her friend, HUNTER SCANGARELO.
TOMMY (V.O.)
My daughter's friend was there to drive my daughter, Meadow, to school.
HUNTER
staring out window
Meadow, your father with those ducks.
CARMELA
Have something more than just cran-apple juice, ladies. You need brain food for school.
TOMMY JR. enters. He's thirteen. He sits, starts spooning cereal in. Carmela smooches him. Everyone ad-libs happy birthdays. He acknowledges, his mouth crammed with food.
HUNTER.
The male and female duck just made a home in your pool and 'did it'? Weird.
CARMELA
crosses with pastry
Girls, you want some of last night's sfogliatell'?
MEADOW
Get out of here with that fat.
CARMELA
Oh, have a bite.
MEADOW
Wait - like Italian pastry is brain food?
HUNTER
Bon Jovi? Hello?
They laugh. Tommy Jr.'s hand goes in the box; he dunks the Italian pastry in his cereal milk and eats. The girls 'ee-ew'.
HUNTER
How do you stay so skinny, Mrs. Soprano?
Carmela isn't listening. She is staring out somberly.
CARMELA
Him. With those ducks.
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - POOL - DAY
Tommy has waded into the pool to adjust a plywood launching ramp he has constructed for the ducks. His robe floats on the water; he doesn't care. He talks to the ducks.
TOMMY
Don't you worry. I'll make you a better ramp.
The ducklings suddenly furiously flap tneir wings in proto flight, following their mother's lead.
TOMMY
Kids! Come here!
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
TOMMY (V.O.)
Hey, kids!
The teenagers trudge dutifully to the door.
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - POOL - DAY
TOMMY
Look! They're trying to fly.
KIDS
bored, humoring
Nice, dad. National Geographic.
They go back inside.
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
HUNTER
It is so cool you're going to be able to come to Aspen with my family at Christmas. Last year at Aspen? I saw Skeet Ulrich. As close as from where you're sitting.
MEADOW
Omigod.
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
TOMMY
My wife feels this friend of Meadow's is a bad influence.
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
CARMELA
Miss Meadow, we made a deal - you keep your school grades up and you keep your curfew between now and Christmas - then you get to go.
MEADOW
edge
I know that.
Tommy enters, robe gone, his lower torso wrapped in a beach towel. He claps Tommy Jr. on the back.
TOMMY
Happy birthday, son.
He runs his hand on Carmela's butt, but she seems not to notice.
So he starts slap fighting with Tommy Jr.
CARMELA
You're going to be home tonight for Tommy Jr.'s party, right?
to his grunt
Birdman. Hello?
Tommy is reaching for The Audubon Society "Master Guide to Birding" and getting engrossed.
TOMMY
I'll get home from work early.
CARMELA
I wasn't talking about work.
She moves off sullenly. As he watches her -
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Tommy - in the present - a strained silence. She stares.
TOMMY
This isn't going to work. I can't talk about my personal life.
MELFI
It's hard for everybody.
TOMMY
You don't understand.
MELFI
Finish telling me about the day you collapsed.
INT. CHRIS' CAR - DAY
Back to the past. Brand new Lexus 400.
TOMMY (V.O.)
I rode to work with my nephew, Christopher ...he's learning the business.
CHRIS MOLTISANTI (25) is in cool-ass cruise mode. Good looking - almost pretty - wears an earring, a Jersey Shark's ball cap. He is chuckling at Howard Stern on the radio. Tommy rides passenger, engrossed in his Audubon book.
Rust-belt New Jersey floats by: the Meadowlands - mile after mile of marsh, iron bridges, and raw honking trucking. The skyline of Manhattan beckons from the distance.
TOMMY (V.O.)
He's an example of what I was saying before -
TOMMY
You call whatsisname at Triboro Towers about the hauling contract?
CHRIS
I got home too late last night. I didn't want to wake the man up.
TOMMY
You get up early this morning and call? He's always in the office at six.
CHRIS
I was nauseous this morning. My mom told me I shouldn't even go in today.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Bear in mind, this is a kid who just bought himself a 60,000 dollar Lexus.
They are now in a business district. Chris' head whips around.
EXT. STREET - BUSINESS DISTRICT - US/HMO - DAY
CHRIS
It's that guy. Mahaffey.
TOMMY
Get out.
CHRIS
Back there. See? With the boo-boo in red?
TOMMY
Back up.
ON MAHAFFEY
a forty-four-year-old executive, walking with a YOUNG WOMAN, a secretary. They carry lattes and bagels.
The Lexus pulls up. Tommy gets out -
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Tommy has stopped talking.
TOMMY
There was an issue of an outstanding loan -
MELFI
Let me stop you a second.
TOMMY
Sure.
MELFI
I have no idea where this story is going...but there are a few ethical ground rules we should quickly get out of the way.
He waits. She smiles nervously.
MELFI
You said you were in waste management...
TOMMY
Recycle. The environment.
MELFI
Dr. Cusamano, besides being your family physician, is also your next door neighbor. See what I'm saying?
TOMMY
I get it. Yeah.
MELFI
dry mouth
What you tell me inhere falls under doctor/patient confidentiality. Except - if I was, for example, to hear that a...say a...murder?...was about to take place -
quickly
- not that I'm saying - but, if.. Well, anything like that...where a patient tells me someone is going to be hurt? I'm supposed to go to the authorities. Technically.
TOMMY
long beat
Oh.
MELFI
I don't know what happened with this Mahaffey fellow. I'm just saying.
TOMMY
I see.
beat
Nothing. We had coffee.
EXT. STREET - BUSINESS DISTRICT - US/HMQ - DAY
When Mahaffey sees Tommy, his latte spatters the sidewalk as he takes off running! Chris takes after him.
THE PURSUIT
Chris and Mahaffey burn up the sidewalk. Bystanders peer curiously.
Tommy calmly gets behind the Lexus wheel, makes a U-turn.
Mahaffey runs toward a sleek five story office building, US/HMO.
He cuts across the lawn making for the front entrance.
MAHAFFEY
Security!
Chris closes, grabs him by his neck, tries to swing him to the ground. Chris loses his footing on the slippery grass and Mahaffey twirls free. But Chris is now between him and the door; Mahaffey cuts for the parking lot, panting, full out, grabbing in his pocket for his car keys. Chris runs after him into the lot.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Tommy suddenly draws abreast of Chris in the Lex, gives a cheerful TOOT, then accelerates down the parking aisle.
Mahaffey's legs churning.
THE LEXUS
deliberately clips Mahaffey. He hurtles over the car about thirty feet, crashes to the ground. Tommy calmly gets out.
MAHAFFEY
My leg! It's broken! Oh fuck, oh fuck, the bone's coming through!
Tommy starts punching him in the face briskly and efficiently.
TOMMY
punching
I'll give you a fuckin' bone. Where's my money?
The secretary comes up, watches in horror. One of the Lexus' headlights hangs by its wires and Chris broken-heartedly tries to put it back in.
- MAHAFFEY
I'll get the money!
TOMMY
punching, but tiring
I know you'll get the -
sees Chris fussing over the.car
The fuck you doirig? Get over here.
Chris crosses, takes over the physical labor - kicking Mahaffey in chest and stomach while Tommy catches his breath and picks up where he left off -
TOMMY
I know you'll get the money. What you ought to fuckin' get is a fuckin' cork to put in your mouth.
US/HMO employees watch from windows.
TOMMY
as he and Chris kick in Mahaffey's ribs
Huh? You tell people I'm nothin' to worry about compared to who used to run things?
MAHAFFEY
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Tommy heads back to the car. Chris' eyes rest on the eyes of Mahaffey's young, horrified secretary. Chris gets in the car.
MAHAFFEY
SCREAMING
My leg. Ohmigod! Fuck!
TOMMY
sees US/HMO sign
HMO. What are you fuckin' crying about? At least you're covered.
INT. CHRIS' CAR - DAY
Chris drives. Tommy massages his knuckles.
CHRIS
What you thinking about?
TOMMY
HMO's.
CHRIS
Homos?
TOMMY
HMO! HMO! It's a medical care provider. Read a fuckin' paper once in a while, Christopher.
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Tommy and Melfi are looking at each otbsr in the psychiatric silence.
MELFI
So you had coffee.
TOMMY
Right.
MELFI
Go on.
TOMMY
Next? Let' s see, I had a breakfast meeting.
EXT. THE PORK STORE - DAY
Italian-American inner city neighborhood; an Italian butcher shop with a plaster pig on top. At a little table out front under the Stella D'Oro umbrella sit Tommy, Chris, a large man, BIG PUSSY BONPENSIERO, PAT "PAULIE WALNUTS" GUALTIERI and trash hauling company owner DICK BARONE. A young butcher in a blood-stained apron serves espesso.
BIG PUSSY BONPENSIERO should not be confused with LITTLE PUSSY MALANGA., of whom we shall learn more shortly.
TOMMY
So what's going on at Triboro Towers?
BIG PUSSY
The site manager wants to renew his contract with Dick. But this Kolar Sanitation...
DICK BARONE
Nationwide company.
BIG PUSSY
The Kolar brothers, they're some kind of Czechoslovakian immigrants or some shit - - these polacks'll haul the paper, plastic and aluminum for seventy-five thousand a month less than Dick.
TOMMY
So Kolar pays you the regular forty times the monthly for stealing your stop.
BIG PUSSY
That's the thing - he won't. Says if he could tell the Commie bosses back in Czechoslovakia to go fuck themselves, he can fuckin' tell us.
TOMMY
Fucking garbage business.
BIG PUSSY
I know. It's all changing.
CHRIS
Let me see what I can do.
TOMMY
You sure? You over your stomach ache?
A black STS has pulled up and nattily dressed SILVIO DANTE heads for the Pork Store. Tommy spots him. All ad lib hellos all around.
SILVIO
Gabriella sends me down here for the gabagool.
PAULIE WALNUTS
Best in the area.
SILVIO
Tom, I'm thinking: did you go to elementary school with a guy named Artie Bucco?
INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
TOMMY
So this situation came up. It involves my uncle. I can't go into detail on this one.
MELFI
relieved
That's fine.
TOMMY
But I'll say this - my uncle adds to my general stress level.
BACK TO THE PORK STORE
SILVIO
Probably none of my business, but down at the club, the word is your Uncle- Junior is going to whack Little Pussy Malanga...
EXT. BUCCO'S VESUVIO - DAY
Chris' Lexus drives up to the restaurant.
SILVIO (V.O.)
...in your friend Artie Bucco's restaurant.
INT. BUCCO'S VESUVIO - DAY
A cozy Italian eatery for politicans, wise-guys. Tommy and Chris stop at a booth ruled by Tommy's uncle, CORRADO "JUNIOR" SOPRANO, and other geriatric mobsters in cheap cardigan sweaters. Junior is smallish with coke-bottle lenses. His muscle, BEPPY, sits beside him.
TOMMY
pats his neck
Uncle Jun', how you doing?
JUNIOR
warm hug
I was just talking about you. Tommy Jr.'s birthday dinner tonight, right?
TOMMY
Don't buy him anything big. We overindulge him.
Tommy and Chris move on to ARTHUR BUCCO - an affable restaurateur Tommy's age. They hug.
TOMMY
Arthur! What's the word at land of a thousand clams?
ARTHUR
Jefe.
CHARMAINE, Arthur's wife, watches sourly from the cash register.
Tommy blows her a big kiss. He and Chris sit at a prime booth.
CHRIS
You know what that means for Arthur one of these old mutts gets wet in here?
TOMMY
Ruin his business.
CHRIS
You better sit down with your uncle.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Uncle Junior is my father's brother. A good guy, but old now and crabby. He used to take me to Yankee games when I was a kid.. I love my uncle.
EXT. ELM PARKWAY/LIVIA'S HOUSE - DAY
A middle-class street of three-story clapboard homes.
TOMMY (V.O.)
At the same time, Uncle Junior also told our girl cousins I would never be a varsity athlete. I found out he'd said that and, frankly, it was a tremendous blow to my self-esteem.
Chris waits in the Lexus as Tommy carries a Bose carton to a large three-story home, pats himself down for a key, RINGS- bell.
Presently...
VOICE
Who's there?
TOMMY
It's me, mom.
VOICE
Who are you?
TOMMY
Ma, open the door!
VOICE
Tommy?
TOMMY
Ma, open the door!
Four locks operate, the door squeaks open a crack and Tommy's mother, LIVIA SOPRANO, warily peers out. Tommy enters.
INT. LIVIA'S HOUSE - DAY
TOMMY
Jeez, ma, get some air in here.
He flings open a window. Livia looks older than her sixty-nine years. She's wearing a housecoat and slippers.
LIVIA
Did you lock the door behind you?
TOMMY
wearily
Yes.
LIVIA
Somebody phoned me last night. After dark.
TOMMY
Who?
LIVIA
You think I'd answer the ph^ne? It was dark out.
TOMMY
Ma, that I will never get. The phone is an auditory thing. Dark is an eye thing. Some-people won't go out after dark - okay - get jumped from the shadows - but not answer the phone after dark?
LIVIA
Listen to him. He knows everything. You want some lunch? I got eggplant.
TOMMY
I just ate.
She goes into the kitchen and starts fizing him food anyway.
Tommy takes a new table-top CD player from the carton.
TOMMY
Know who I just saw? Uncle Junior.
LIVIA
That one. Think he ever comes to see his sister-in-law?
TOMMY
Remember Artie Bucco? My friend in elementary school?
LIVIA
I still see his mother. She tells me he calls her every day.
TOMMY
doesn't rise to the bait
Thing is...Uncle Junior...he's gonna make a problem for Arthur. It would impact on Arthur's livelihood.
LIVIA
eyes CD player
What's that?
TOMMY
CD player.
LIVIA
put upon
For who? For me? I don't want it.
TOMMY
You love music. All the old stuff's being reissued on CD, your favorites.
shows CDs
Look...Connie Francis...'Pajama Game'...
He puts a CD on. Steam Heat from 'Pajama Game' fills the room.
He tries to waltz her around.
TOMMY
Ma, you need something to occupy your mind. When dad died you were going to do all kinds of things -
LIVIA
tears up
He was a saint.
TOMMY
I know, but he's gone. You were going to do volunteer work, travel. You've done nothing.
LIVIA
Don't you tell me how to live. You shut up.
TOMMY
I worry about you.
LIVIA
Don't you start with that nursing home again!
TOMMY
It is not a nursing home. How many times I have to say it? It's a 'retirement community'. You're with active seniors your own age. They do things. They go places.
LIVIA
crying
I've seen these women in these nursing homes. In these wheelchairs. Babbling like idiots. Eat your eggplant.
TOMMY
I told you I just ate lunch! Maybe you could talk to Uncle Jun' about Artie Bucco. He respects you...
LIVIA
If your uncle has business with Arthur - then he knows what he's doing.
TOMMY
And I don't?
LIVIA
All I know is girls take better care of their mothers than sone..
TOMMY
I bought CDs for the broken record lady. I didn't drive my sisters out of state.
He gets up. Moves toward front door.
TOMMY
I expect to see you at Tommy Jr.'s dinner tonight with the baked ziti.
LIVIA
Only if someone picks me up and drives me home. I don't drive when they're predicting rain.
EXT. LIVIA'S HOUSE - DAY
TOMMY
You're a healthy girl. It's, good for you to drive. Use it or lose it.
kisses her on cheek
I have to get back to work.
LIVIA
Sure. Run off.
EXT. SOPRANO HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
Carmela has generated an astounding array of food, yet she still looks, as Chris once remarked, "eminently fuckable." Tommy is taking off his jacket, she hands him a platter of steaks and sausage.
TOMMY (V.O.)
That night it was my son's birthday party.
TOMMY
Maybe I should go get my mother.
CARMELA
No way. She's jerking your chain.
She lets him kiss her. Just then -
FATHER PHIL
You had a recipe for creme anglais all the time, Carmela. Right here in 'Julia Child.
FATHER PHIL, thirtysomething priest, wanders out of the house carrying a cookbook, wearing an apron. Tommy immediately chills.
FATHER PHIL
Oh, hi, Tom. You like creme anglais?
TOMMY
You bless it, I'll eat it.
TOMMY JR.
enters with portable phone
Grandma's not coming. She started crying and hung up.
TOMMY
She needs a purpose in life.
CARMELA
Your mother's tougher than you think.
TOMMY JR.
bummed
No fucking ziti now?
BOTH PARENTS
sharply
Hey I
VOICE
Where's everybody?
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - HALLWAYS - DAY
Uncle Junior wanders, his eyes swimming in the thick lenses. He carries a huge birthday present and a wrinkled paper bag.
JUNIOR
I brung fresh arugala from my garden.
EXT. SOPRANO BACKYARD - DAY
Tommy stands at a top-of-the-line barbeque kettle, lights fluid-soaked charcoal. Whoosh. He is moving the lighter fluid out of the way to make room when -
The duck family are all beating their wings in the pool. CAMERA slows to dreamlike slo-mo as the mother levitates. The first duckling becomes airborne... then the second...then the others...they follow their mother up into the air.
TOMMY
watches with both joy and horror as they circle his yard once, then fly off forever, their QUACKS receding.
TOMMY (V.O.)
At first it felt like ginger ale in my skull.
Suddenly Tommy's eyes roll, he clutches his head, crashes into the kettle. The lighter fluid can drops from his hand onto the coals. He falls to the grass.
Carmela and family rush out.
CARMELA
Oh, my God -
Silvio Dante and family, just arriving, react in alarm.
Carmela is moving toward Tommy. Is driven back as the can of lighter fluid explodes - a ball of orange flame that completely destroys the kettle. Tommy, unconscious, has no awareness.
Silvio grabs a fire extinguisher and starts shooting hot coals that have blown out of the grille.
INT. MRI CENTER - MRI MACHINE ROOM - DAY
The magnetic oracle hums. Tommy lies alone and naked on a tray, about to be served to the machine.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Dr. Cusamano put me in the hospital. I had every kind of test.
A speaker in the room clicks on.
VOICE
When you're in the machine, there's a microphone by your head if you get claustrophobia and have to come out. Only we suggest that you don't do that 'cause we'll: only have to start over again from the beginning.
TOMMY
Okay.
No answer. Moments pass. Nothing happens. A door opens.
TOMMY
Carmela...?
She brings a chair over from the wall. Sits beside him.
CARMELA
I thought maybe you'd want some company.
TOMMY
surprised
Thanks. Six-thirty in the morning? How are the kids?
CARMELA
Worried about you - I tola Tommy Jr. we'd rain check his birthday.
TOMMY
Carm', you think I have a brain tumor?
CARMELA
Well, we'll find out.
TOMMY
pissed off
What a bedside manner. Very encouraging.
CARMELA
What are you gonna, not know?
Beat.
TOMMY
We've had some good times, some good years.
CARMELA
Here he goes now with the nostalgia.
TOMMY
What I'm saying - no marriage is perfect.
CARMELA
But having that godmar' on the side helps.
TOMMY
I don't see her anymore, I told you. How do you think I like it, having that priest in my house all the time?
CARMELA
eyes narrow
Don't even go there. Father is a spiritual mentor - he's helping me to be a better Catholic.
TOMMY
We all have different needs.
CARMELA
What's different between you and me is you're going to Hell when you die.
That about kills the conversation. The machine hums. A technician enters and Tommy tenses up. Carmela unhesitatingly takes his hand. The technician gives Carmela prism eyeglasses which she places on Tommy.
TOMMY'S POV
a weird prism look ninety degrees past his own head that allows him to keep tenuous visual contact with Carmela as he goes into the machine.
Carmela smooths his hair, says something loving. But the MRI machine makes its hellish hammering which drowns everything out and continues into -
INT. THE PORK STORE - NIGHT
Chris, alone, does a Kung Fu dance in the glow of the meat cases.
TOMMY (V.O.)
My nephew, Christopher, was handling the garbage contract problem while I was in the hospital. On this here also you don't need to know the details.
A Ford van with KOLAR SANITATION on its door pulls up outside.
EMIL KOLAR, 24, gets out. He comes to the Pork Store, knocks.
The door is opened a crack by Chris.
