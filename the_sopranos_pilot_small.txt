INT. DR. MELFI'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
THOMAS SOPRANO, 40, sits and waits. Uneasily. Staring confusedly at a vaguely erotic Klimpt reproduction. Inner door opens. DR. JENNIFER MELFI (attractive, 35) appears.
MELFI

INT. DR. MELFI'S OFFICE - DAY
Melfi gestures Tommy to a choice of seating.
MELFI
Have a seat.
She seats herself in a facing armchair. She looks at him with a polite, expectant gaze. He stares back, waiting. There is utter silence. Nothing happens. Such is psychotherapy. Finally-
MELFI
My understanding from your family physician, Dr. Cusamano, is you collapsed? Were unable to breathe? Possibly a panic attack?
TOMMY
They said it was a panic attack - because all the neurological work and blood came back negative. They sent me here.
MELFI
You don't agree you had a panic attack?
He laughs - too loud.
MELFI
How are you feeling now?
TOMMY

MELFI
What line of work are you in?
TOMMY
Waste management consultant.
She keeps that psychiatric poker-face. Yet there was a reaction.

TOMMY
Look...it's impossible for me to talk to a psychiatrist.
MELFI
Any thoughts at all on why you blacked out?
Tommy shrugs. Fidgets. Then -
TOMMY
I don't know. Stress, maybe?
MELFI
Stress? About what?
DAWN
the first rays over the post-industrial landscape.
TOMMY (V.O.)
Well, I once heard some guy use this expression, 'The sun setting over the empire...?'
EXT. SOPRANO HOUSE - DAWN
split-level. New Jersey. The only thing distinguishing it from its neighbors is high security fencing and mercury vapor lamps that make the lawn bright enough for night baseball. A sensor reels the dawn's rays and the lamps switch off and -
INT. SOPRANO HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN
TOMMY'S EYE
slams open from sleep. He stares soberly up at the ceiling.
